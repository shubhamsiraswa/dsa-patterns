## 🔥 Commitment

**Daily Non-Negotiables:**
- ✅ 1.5 hours DSA practice (morning)
- ✅ 30 min review/learning (evening)
- ✅ Update progress.md
- ✅ Maintain streak

**Weekly Non-Negotiables:**
- ✅ 15-20 problems solved

- ✅ Weekly review (Sunday)
- ✅ GitHub commits daily

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- 🚩 Missing a day → Do 1 problem minimum to keep streak
- 🚩 Spending 2+ hours on one problem → Look at solution after 40 min
- 🚩 Feeling overwhelmed → Reduce to 2 problems/day temporarily
- 🚩 Copying without understanding → Close solution, code from scratch
